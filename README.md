To use the library in your projects, add the following (or what ever suits your needs) to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
source 'https://github.com/qvik/qvik-podspecs.git'

pod 'QvikNetwork'
```

And the following to your source:

```swift
import QvikNetwork
```

## Versions

Use the following library versions for the corresponding Swift language versions:

* 6.x - Swift 5
* 5.x - Swift 4.2

## Dependencies

The library has dependencies to the following external modules:

* [QvikSwift](https://github.com/qvik/qvik-swift-ios)
* [AlamoFire 4](https://cocoapods.org/?q=alamofire)
* [XCGLogger](https://cocoapods.org/?q=XCGLogger)
* [CryptoSwift](https://cocoapods.org/pods/CryptoSwift)

## Controlling the library's log level

The library may emit logging for errors, and if you tell it to, debug stuff. Enable debug logging as such:

```swift
QvikNetwork.logLevel = .debug // Or .info, .verbose
```

## Features

This chapter introduces the library's classes.

### DownloadManager

The purpose of *DownloadManager* (and the related classes *DownloadGroup* and *Download*) is to provide easy-to-use API for downloading files over HTTP(S), typically dynamic application resources such as images and data files. *DownloadManager* also provides a way of grouping downloads together for tracking the overall download progress instead of adding this code
to the application logic. Downloading multiple items at once is common feature in modern mobile applications. *DownloadManager* and the related classes are thread safe.

Example usage:

```swift
let downloadUrls = ["http://example.com/1", "http://example.com/2", "http://example.com/3"]
let downloadManager = DownloadManager.default
let downloadGroup = downloadManager.createGroup()

downloadGroup.progressCallback = { [weak self] totalBytesRead, progress in
	updateProgressUI(progress)
}

downloadGroup.completionCallback = { [weak self] numErrors in
	log.debug("All downloads completed, \(numErrors) errors")
    updateCompletedUI()
}

for url in downloadUrls {
	let download = downloadGroup.download(url)
    download.progressCallback = { [weak self] totalBytesRead, totalBytesExpectedToRead in
	    let progress = Double(totalBytesRead) / Double(totalBytesExpectedToRead)
    	log.debug("Download progress for url \(url): \(progress)")
    }
}

```

### ImageCache

A very fast, disk-backed in-memory image cache, featuring configurable storage location, file format (JPEG/PNG) and disk storage max age etc. It can also be configured to automatically downscale any downloaded images to a maximum size (retaining aspect ratio) before insertion to the in-memory storage and disk. *ImageCache* is thread safe.

Example usage:

```swift
func imageLoaded(notification: Notification) {
	if let imageUrl = notification.userInfo?[ImageCache.urlParam] as? String {
    	// Check if it is my image
		if imageUrl == self.imageUrl {
  	      // Now the image is in the cache - get it 
			let image = ImageCache.sharedInstance().getImage(url: imageUrl, loadPolicy: .memory)
            // TODO use the image for something
        }
    }
}

// ..

let imageCache = ImageCache.sharedInstance()

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, #selector(imageLoaded), name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: ImageCache.cacheImageLoadedNotification), object: nil)
        
// This will trigger a fetch over the network if not found in cache
guard let image = imageCache.getImage(url: imageUrl, loadPolicy: .Network) else {
	log.debug("Requested image not found in in-memory cache; waiting for a load from disk or network")
    // .. wait for imageLoaded() to get called
}

```

### CachedImageView

A UIImageView that is backed up by *ImageCache*; features automatic image retrieval from the cache (and hence from the network if not found locally). Also supports JPEG Thumbnails (see below) as well as a fade-in effect.

Sample usage:

```swift
@IBOutlet private weak var imageView: CachedImageView!

func populateView(message: Message) {
	// Will automatically trigger load from cache/network and populate the image when done
	imageView.imageUrl = message.imageUrl
    
    // Will display this image while the other one loads
    imageView.placeholderImage = smallerImage
    
    // Control how fast the fade-in animation for async loaded images is
    imageView.imageFadeInDuration = 0.5
}

```

### BaseRemoteService

This is a superclass for a Remote API service built on top of the Alamofire HTTP library. It provides response parsing and wraps all the Alamofire APIs, reducing boiler plate from the actual implementation. For full feature set, see the code.

Example implementation:

```swift
class RemoteService: BaseRemoteService {
  private static let singletonInstance = RemoteService()

  class func sharedInstance() -> RemoteService {
    return singletonInstance
  }

  /// Attempts to verify an email address
  func verifyEmailAddress(email: String, completionCallback: (RemoteResponse -> Void)) {
    let url = "\(baseUrl)/api/verifyemail"
    let params = ["email": email]

    request(.POST, url, parameters: params, encoding: .JSON, headers: nil) { response in
      completionCallback(response)
    }
  }

  // TODO Other methods ..

  init() {
    let additionalHeaders = [
      "X-My-API-Key": "asldasdaksdjhakdjhasdkjh",
      "X-My-Api-Version": "1",
      "X-My-Client": getClientId()
    ]

    super.init(backgroundSessionId: "com.example.MyApp", additionalHeaders: additionalHeaders, timeout: 5)
  }
}
```

### MockRemoteService

You like to unit test your REST interface? With ```MockRemoteService``` you can! Set up your interface to use ```BaseRemoteService``` with an has-a relationship instead of a is-a relationship, instantiate ```MockRemoteService``` and use it instead of ```BaseRemoteService```. For example like this: 

```swift
class TestRemoteService {
    let remoteImpl: BaseRemoteService
    let baseUrl = "http://www.site.com"

    func list(callback: ((RemoteResponse) -> Void)) {
        let url = "\(baseUrl)/list"

        remoteImpl.request(.GET, url, parameters: nil, callback: callback)
    }

    func update(name name: String, age: Int, married: Bool, callback: ((RemoteResponse) -> Void)) {
        let url = "\(baseUrl)/update"

        let params: [String: AnyObject] = ["name": name, "age": age, "married": married]

        remoteImpl.request(.POST, url, parameters: params, callback: callback)
    }

    init(remoteImpl: BaseRemoteService) {
        self.remoteImpl = remoteImpl
    }
}
```

And build test cases like this: 

```swift
    func testPathAndParamMapping() {
        let mockService = MockRemoteService()

        // Create a precondition that /update always fails if params age = 17, married = true are set
        mockService.addOperationMappingForPath("/update", mapping: (failureProbability: 1.0, params: ["age": 17, "married": true], successResponse: ["status": "ok"], failureResponse: ["status": "failed"], failureError: .ServerError))

        // Set default success response content
        mockService.successResponse = ["status": "ok"]

        let remoteService = TestRemoteService(remoteImpl: mockService)

        let mustSucceed = expectationWithDescription("Must succeed with these params")
        let mustFail = expectationWithDescription("Must fail with these params")

        // Start a request that should succeed
        remoteService.update(name: "Leslie", age: 18, married: true) { response in
            if response.success {
                // Also check that proper success response content is in place
                if let status = response.parsedJson?["status"] as? String where status == "ok" {
                    mustSucceed.fulfill()
                }
            }
        }

        // Start a request that should fail
        remoteService.update(name: "Leslie", age: 17, married: true) { response in
            if !response.success {
                // Also check that proper failure content is in place
                if let status = response.parsedJson?["status"] as? String where status == "failed" {
                    mustFail.fulfill()
                }
            }
        }

        waitForExpectationsWithTimeout(1.0, handler: nil)
    }
}
```

### JPEG Thumbnails

JPEG thumbnails can be used for fast image previews. To understand the concept, read the links mentioned in the ```JpegThumbnails.swift``` source file.

```swift
/// Use a thumbnail:
thumbnailImageView.image = jpegThumbnailDataToImage(data: thumbnailData, maxSize: self.frame.size)

/// Or, benefit from background threading etc. in CachedImageView: 
myCachedImageView.thumbnailDominantColor = myImageObject.thumbDominantColor
myCachedImageView.thumbnailData = myImageObject.thumbData
```
